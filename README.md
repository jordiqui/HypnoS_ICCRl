  ### Hypnos-IJCCRL-071225 Overview


Hypnos-IJCCRL-071225 is a free and strong UCI chess engine derived from Stockfish
that analyzes chess positions and computes the optimal moves.

Hypnos-IJCCRL-071225 does not include a graphical user interface (GUI) that is required
to display a chessboard and to make it easy to input moves. These GUIs are 
developed independently from Hypnos-IJCCRL-071225 and are available online.

  ### Acknowledgements

This project is built upon the  [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish)  and would not have been possible without the exceptional work of the Stockfish developers.
While Hypnos-IJCCRL-071225 has diverged from the latest upstream version due to structural differences and the integration of a custom learning system, the core foundation, ideas, and architecture remain deeply rooted in Stockfish.
I am sincerely grateful to the entire Stockfish team for making such an outstanding engine openly available to the community.

  ### Self-Learning

*	### Experience file structure:

1. e4 (from start position)
1. c4 (from start position)
1. Nf3 (from start position)
1 .. c5 (after 1. e4)
1 .. d6 (after 1. e4)

2 positions and a total of 5 moves in those positions

Now imagine HypnoS plays 1. e4 again, it will store this move in the experience file, but it will be duplicate because 1. e4 is already stored. The experience file will now contain the following:
1. e4 (from start position)
1. c4 (from start position)
1. Nf3 (from start position)
1 .. c5 (after 1. e4)
1 .. d6 (after 1. e4)
1. e4 (from start position)

Now we have 2 positions, 6 moves, and 1 duplicate move (so effectively the total unique moves is 5)

Duplicate moves are a problem and should be removed by merging with existing moves. The merge operation will take the move with the highst depth and ignore the other ones. However, when the engine loads the experience file it will only merge duplicate moves in memory without saving the experience file (to make startup and loading experience file faster)

At this point, the experience file is considered fragmented because it contains duplicate moves. The fragmentation percentage is simply: (total duplicate moves) / (total unique moves) * 100
In this example we have a fragmentation level of: 1/6 * 100 = 16.67%


  ### Experience Readonly

  Default: False If activated, the experience file is only read.
  
  ### Experience Book

  HypnoS play using the moves stored in the experience file as if it were a book

  ### Experience Book Width

The number of moves to consider from the book for the same position.

  ### Experience Book Eval Importance

The quality of experience book moves has been revised heavily based on feedback from users. The new logic relies on a new parameter called (Experience Book Eval Importance) which defines how much weight to assign to experience move evaluation vs. count.

The maximum value for this new parameter is: 10, which means the experience move quality will be 100% based on evaluation, and 0% based on count

The minimum value for this new parameter is: 0, which means the experience move quality will be 0% based on evaluation, and 100% based on count

The default value for this new parameter is: 5, which means the experience move quality will be 50% based on evaluation, and 50% based on count	

  ### Experience Book Min Depth

Type: Integer
Default Value: 27
Range: Max to 64
This option sets the minimum depth threshold for moves to be included in the engine's Experience Book. Only moves that have been searched at least to the specified depth will be considered for inclusion.

  ### Experience Book Max Moves

Type: Integer
Default Value: 16
Range: 1 to 100
	This is a setup to limit the number of moves that can be played by the experience book.
	If you configure 16, the engine will only play 16 moves (if available).

  ### Tactical Mode

Default: false
Enables a more aggressive search profile intended to improve tactical solving.
This mode selectively reduces or disables pruning and LMR in specific tactical situations, increasing the engine’s sensitivity to forcing moves, sacrifices, and narrow winning lines.

Tactical Mode is designed for problem-solving; it will significantly increase node count and is not recommended for long-time control competitive play.
  ### Variety

Enables randomization of move selection in balanced positions not covered by the opening book.  
A higher value increases the probability of deviating from the mainline, potentially at the cost of Elo.

This option is mainly intended for testing, analysis, or generating varied self-play games.

Set to `0` for fully deterministic behavior.  
Typical useful range: `10–20` for light variety in early game.

 Note: Variety works in combination with `Variety Max Score` and `Variety Max Moves`, which control the conditions under which randomness can apply.
  ### Variety Max Score

Maximum score threshold (in centipawns) below which randomization of the best move is allowed.  
If the absolute evaluation is below this value, the engine may apply a small, controlled random bonus  
to the best move score in order to increase variability in balanced positions.

- A value of `0` disables the feature (fully deterministic behavior).
- Typical values range from `10` to `30`.
- The hard maximum is `50`, beyond which the randomness could affect clearly winning or losing positions and is not recommended.

This feature is primarily intended for testing purposes, to introduce diversity in games that would otherwise be repetitive.

  ### Variety Max Moves

Maximum game ply (half-moves) under which the variety bonus can be applied.  
Once the game progresses beyond this ply count, the randomization feature is disabled.

- `0` disables the feature entirely.
- Values between `10` and `30` are typical for introducing diversity early in the game.
- The hard cap is `40`, since variety in late-game scenarios is generally undesirable.

This setting prevents randomness from affecting important endgame decisions. 


  ### Random Open Mode

Default: false
Enables controlled randomization during the opening phase, selecting among near-equal root moves based on a softmax probability distribution.

This feature increases opening variety in self-play, training, and large-scale testing.

Important:
Random Open Mode does not interfere with Polyglot books nor with the Experience Book (.exp).
If a book move is available (Polyglot or EXP), the engine plays the book move and completely bypasses Random Open Mode.

  ### Random Open Plies

Default: 16 — Range: 0–20
Maximum number of plies during which Random Open Mode may be applied.
Higher values increase opening variety; lower values restrict it to the very early moves.

  ### Random Open MultiPV

Default: 3 — Range: 1–6
Ensures a minimum MultiPV during the first plies.
This guarantees a stable pool of alternative moves for the random selector.

  ### Random Open DeltaCp

Default: 25 — Range: 0–100
Centipawn window used to determine which moves are considered “near-equal” to the best move.
Only moves within this window can be sampled by Random Open Mode.

  ### Random Open SoftmaxT

Default: 12 — Range: 1–40
Softmax temperature parameter (in centipawns).
Controls how strongly the probability distribution favors the top moves.

Low values → more deterministic behavior

High values → more randomness and diversity

  ### Random Seed

Default: 0 — Range: 0–10000
Controls the reproducibility of the random selection system.

0: non-deterministic (uses system time)

>0: deterministic — identical sequences of random choices for the same position and seed

Useful for debugging, regression testing, or reproducible self-play experiments.

  ### NNUE Dynamic Weights

Type: Boolean — Default: true

Description: enables dynamic blending of NNUE weights wMat/wPos using tapered game phase (0..24 → t 0..1024) and a small complexity boost when |psqt - positional| is large. No Shashin.

Interaction: if NNUE ManualWeights = true, Dynamic is bypassed (Manual has priority).

Note: the Dyn Open/Endgame … options below define the profiles used by Dynamic.

  ### NNUE ManualWeights

Type: Boolean — Default: false

Description: forces manual weights:

wMat = 125 + NNUE StrategyMaterialWeight

wPos = 131 + NNUE StrategyPositionalWeight
and ignores all Dyn … options.

  ### NNUE StrategyMaterialWeight

Type: Integer (-12..12) — Default: 0

Description: delta over 125 (Manual mode only).

  ### NNUE StrategyPositionalWeight

Type: Integer (-12..12) — Default: 0

Description: delta over 131 (Manual mode only).

  ### (Debug) NNUE Log Weights

Type: Boolean — Default: false

Description: prints one line per search at root: wMat/wPos, phase t, small/big net, scaled threshold.
